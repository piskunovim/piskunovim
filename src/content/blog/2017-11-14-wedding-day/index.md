My wife Irina is sitting to my left. We are traveling in a limousine Hammer with our friends Yuri, Nadia, Ilya, Anna, Nikolay and Christina. The rock of the 80s plays on the radio, the rays of the November sun make their way through the clouds.
"Golden autumn" finally came to Krasnodar.

I do not like to exaggerate the meanings of certain moments in life. But believe, whatever person you are, creating your family will be one of the happiest days in your life.

In fact, this is the next stage of working on yourself, which allows you to do things that you can not do alone. To create something more.

### Google Home

I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the use of the new gadget, which is unknown when it appears officially in Russia.

In a very short time, we became friends despite the fact that there is still a lot of work to expand the functionality. Reminders, alarm, timer, playing music, communication, playing in the company. The interface of communication is surprisingly much better than you can imagine.

To know the weather outside or the status of traffic jams, you do not need to open the application, just ask. I you need to order a taxi - ask Google Home to do it (of course if you don't live in Russia). And of course there is a wonderful guide from Google that will lead you to extend possibilities of your home assistant.

I want to note: listening to music on the device is a pleasure. The support of Chromecast and many other devices is also pleasing. And for sure, I'll make another one post about this device(from programming perspective). Anyway it's a really new experience in interface, that for sure will get progress.
