Somehow, I ended up with several pairs of wireless earbuds. Some I bought myself, others appeared randomly, and now I have five of them. I decided to listen to them one by one to figure out which ones sound the most interesting.

**Important:** I’m only evaluating sound quality. I don’t care about active noise cancellation, fit, or battery life—just the pure listening experience: how enjoyable and engaging they sound.

_The models of the earbuds are shown in the photo above._

#### 🔹 Xiaomi – Just Sound

Extremely flat and neutral. No obvious flaws, but also no excitement. They just play music—nothing more.

#### 🔹 JBL – Slightly More Depth, But Still Boring

They try to add some depth, but it doesn’t really save the situation. Overall, they don’t impress, but at least they aren’t as sterile as Xiaomi.

#### 🔹 AirPods Pro Gen 1 – Good Quality, But Outdated

Switching to AirPods Pro Gen 1 after the first two feels like a huge step up in quality. Everything sounds cleaner, more detailed, more alive. But now, with the market evolving, they no longer stand out—many earbuds offer similar quality.

#### 🔹 Pixel Buds A-Series – A Pleasant Surprise!

A budget model from Google, yet the sound is surprisingly impressive. Detail, depth, and spaciousness—compared to them, Xiaomi, JBL, and even AirPods Pro Gen 1 feel underwhelming. I wasn’t expecting them to be this expressive.

#### 🔹 AirPods Pro Gen 2 – The Undisputed Leader

Switching from Pixel Buds A-Series to AirPods Pro 2 doesn’t feel like a massive jump, but the difference in sound clarity is noticeable. Plus, they sound more natural, without unnecessary frequency boosts.

#### Final Thoughts

If we judge purely by sound quality:

❌ **Xiaomi & JBL** – Flat, dull, emotionless.  
✔️ **AirPods Pro Gen 1** – Good but no longer exceptional.  
🔥 **Pixel Buds A-Series** – A real surprise, especially for the price.  
🏆 **AirPods Pro Gen 2** – The cleanest, most natural, simply the best.

_Not a review, not a ranking—just my listening impressions._
