This is the first post in the "Purchases I have not regretted" series. It's not an advertisement or technical review. Please, let me know if you see something wrong in my text that could help to improve it. Thank you!

## Introduction

We live in a time when lots of devices pass through our hands. I think there are two main reasons for this: the fast technological progress and the constant search for a device that would satisfy our needs.

I work a lot on the computer and for me, choosing the right keyboard was a long process. It was a frustrating experience typing on membrane keyboards, and it was sleepless nights for my loved ones due to the loud clicks of mechanical keyboards.

So it was until one day the Logitech MX Keys keyboard fell into my hands, and since then it has become the main keyboard in my house. Today, I am the happy owner of three keyboards of the MX Keys series:

- Logitech MX Keys,ft
- Logitech MX Keys Mini,
- Logitech Craft.

Let's talk about what makes me interested in these keyboards.

## Advantages

There are three main advantages I see in all MX keyboards:

1. Quiet key travel.
2. Ability to connect to three different devices.
3. Wireless connection.
4. Long-life battery.

No matter which version you choose, you can be sure that these functions will be provided with due comfort. By choosing the version you're choosing between the form, the weight and some unusual features that I cannot mark as advantages. Let's try to briefly describe each version.

**Logitech MX Keys** is a balanced full-scale keyboard. It looks and feels great. Weight is average. Connection technology: Logitech Unifying (I'll tell you a little later, this is important).

**Logitech MX Keys Mini** is a minimized version of the MX Keys. Numpad has been removed, the main letter keys haven't been touched, and the bottom row of the keyboard has been more tightly packed. The weight is light. Connectivity technology: Bluetooth.

**Logitech Craft** is a copy of the Logitech MX Keys, weighted down in my opinion an absolutely useless feature called "crown" (an input dial that you won't use even in those cases where it's implied). The main idea behind the crown is to use it in the area of digital design and video editing. But in fact, it doesn't provide functions that could replace convenient editor shortcuts. Moreover, the crown takes extra space and adds weight to the device. As a result, the weight turned out to be heavy, and it's hard not to notice. Connectivity technology: Logitech Unifying.

## About connectivity technologies

Let's talk about two facts that apply to all MX keyboards we're talking about today:

1. You can connect all these keyboards via Bluetooth.

2. You cannot use any of these keyboards as wired ones.

The first item in the list means a lot of devices that you're able to connect easily. And the second one...well...means that we have an issue on BIOS[POST] step when the Bluetooth driver isn't loaded yet.

Some motherboards support Bluetooth loading in POST, but it will cost you extra money. Logitech MX Keys and Logitech Craft have a resolution to this issue called Logitech's Unifying technology. All you need to do is to plug in the USB dongle from the kit inside your computer and the keyboards will be available in BIOS.

Until this year, MX Keys Mini had no workaround. It's truly a Bluetooth keyboard and cannot be connected by using "unifying" technology. That meant, in order to use the keyboard in BIOS, you just need another keyboard. But in 2022 with the new Logitech MX Mechanical Keyboard, the new dongle (Logi Bolt) was announced which is designed to solve the big problem of a small device. So now, if you have MX Keys Mini, I strictly recommend thinking about getting this dongle.

> The first one (orange) is "Unifying" receiver and the second one (green) is "Logi Bolt"

By the way, Logitech Unifying technology also saves battery life, so the keyboard will work longer without charge (Logi Bolt marketing also states that).

All keyboards on a single charge last approximately 14 days. You are more likely to forget when you last charged it. The time frame between charges is really impressive.

## Summary

In terms of form factor, I'd personally choose the MX Keys Mini. It's a great keyboard for travelling, it has all the main features of the MX Keys series, it's ultimately comfortable to use, and it takes up little space at home. But! The BIOS doesn't work out of the box (don't forget about Logi Bolt, but that means additional investment).

The most balanced option is MX Keys. Yes, I'm repeating it again, it's great and that's true. It's full-scaled, it's still lightweight, and it works in BIOS. But the personal preference for more compact devices makes this device number two on my list.

And, I'm sorry, but the Logitech Craft is rubbish. Frankly, it's not so different from the MX Keys, but you have to pay extra money for the noticeable weight, additional space at the top of the keyboard, and, of course, for the "crown" spinner. And that's not fair.

**And the winner is MX Keys Mini!** Just because in my case, the form factor makes more sense than BIOS usage. And again, with Logi Bolt this issue should be resolved. I'll make a note about it if I'll get one. Just look again, how does MX Keys Mini looks like on the table:

PS #1: Some people say that MX Key keyboards has a proverbial slant. That's true, but in fact, you won't notice it. I didn't until someone told me about that.
