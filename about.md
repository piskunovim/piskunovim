My name is Igor Piskunov. I'm a software engineer specializing in JavaScript with more than 7 years of experience. My expertise spans a wide range of software development areas, including:

- Payment systems and self-service terminal software (PayPal, Stripe, Worldline, etc.);
- Corporate product shipping services, scanner software, and integration with popular delivery services (UPS, FedEx, Canada Post, etc.);
- E-commerce products featured on renowned marketplaces (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.);
- Extension development for Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, etc.);
- Facilitating business connections with accounting platforms (Xero, Sage, Exact, Wave, etc.);
- Mobile application development for Android and iOS.

Currently, I am working on the ultimate advertising tracker, [Keitaro.io][keitaro-link], and have recently become fascinated by the field of machine learning.

If you enjoy my blog, notice any errors, have suggestions, or have questions related to the topics mentioned above, I would be delighted to respond to your email.

You can find me [mail@piskunov.im][email-link].

Happy coding!
